  {"id":"ArbuckleEtal2021FeministWarGames","abstract":"# publisher's abstract\n\nFeminist War Games? explores the critical intersections and collisions between feminist values and perceptions of war, by asking whether feminist values can be asserted as interventional approaches to the design, play, and analysis of games that focus on armed conflict and economies of violence. Focusing on the ways that games, both digital and table-top, can function as narratives, arguments, methods, and instruments of research, the volume demonstrates the impact of computing technologies on our perceptions, ideologies, and actions. Exploring the compatibility between feminist values and systems of war through games is a unique way to pose destabilising questions, solutions, and approaches; to prototype alternative narratives; and to challenge current idealisations and assumptions. Positing that feminist values can be asserted as a critical method of design, as an ideological design influence, and as a lens that determines how designers and players interact with and within arenas of war, the book addresses the persistence and brutality of war and issues surrounding violence in games, whilst also considering the place and purpose of video games in our cultural moment. Feminist War Games? is a timely volume that questions the often toxic nature of online and gaming cultures. As such, the book will appeal to a broad variety of disciplinary interests, including sociology, education, psychology, literature, history, politics, game studies, digital humanities, media and cultural studies, and gender studies, as well as those interested in playing, or designing, socially engaged games.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Arbuckle","given":"Alyssa"},{"family":"Saklofske","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Bath","given":"Jon"},{"literal":"INKE"}],"citation-key":"ArbuckleEtal2021FeministWarGames","collection-title":"Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities","container-title":"Feminist War Games?: Mechanisms of War, Feminist Values, and Interventional Games","editor":[{"family":"Saklofske","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Arbuckle","given":"Alyssa"},{"family":"Bath","given":"Jon"}],"ISBN":"978-1-03-208242-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","note":"date_read: 2022-10-11","page":"3-","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Feminist war games?

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"},{"family":"McMillan-Major","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Shmitchell","given":"Shmargaret"}],"citation-key":"BenderEtAl2021DangersStochasticParrots","collection-title":"FAccT '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","container-title-short":"Proc. 2021 ACM Conf.

For example, around 2015 and next years, Big Data was a very powerful trend, which impacted most of the academic research, including humanities and social sciences. Some years later, around 2017, a turn happened with the consolidation of the term Artificial Intelligence, which became even a more paradigmatic trend. All these changes have had to influence DH: How have the field assimilated the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence revolutions? Are the waves detected by Berry still valid or there are needed new ones? What are the trends, concepts and approaches that are dominating the most recent DH studies? What texts and authors were the most influential ones to carry on these transformations?\n\nTo answer these questions, an analytical review of the historic academic production is proposed. The analysis was performed over the academic database Scopus, and analyzed with R programming tools, applying computational analytics in a bibliometric way. The findings are deployed in a public site that will be the product presented and discussed during the meeting, providing interactive visualizations elaborated with plotly, shiny apps and the Sigma JS plugin for networks. Based on this interactive mode, a collaborative research using the site as a tool is planned.","author":[{"family":"Cebral-Loureda","given":"Manuel"}],"citation-key":"Cebral-Loureda2022InteractiveExploratoryAnalysis","event-place":"online","event-title":"Global Digital Humanities Symposium","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,23]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"online","title":"Interactive Exploratory Analysis for DH Trends","type":"speech","URL":"https://msuglobaldh.org/abstracts/#cebral-loureda"},

We begin this essay with a case study of one such system, called “Vault,” in the University of Victoria Libraries, and the work required to migrate from a Software as a Service (SAAS) model (called ContentDM) to a free and open-source software (FOSS) model (a customized instance of Samvera).\n\nVault illustrates what we call “minimal computing from the labor perspective,” which seeks to reduce the opacity of software through “low-tech” practices such as pseudocode, thereby reducing the alienation of practitioners from their projects. Drawing from feminist ecological work on capitalism, affective labor, and care, we advocate for the “degrowth” of digital projects by resisting tendencies to reinvest surplus labor and value into increased productivity. Instead, degrowth as minimal computing prompts practitioners to articulate a project’s needs and desires; what work is required and from whom; and how or whether to sustain this labor for the future.","author":[{"family":"Chan","given":"Tiffany"},{"family":"Sayers","given":"Jentery"}],"citation-key":"Chan.Sayers2022MinimalComputingLabor","container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","container-title-short":"DHQ","editor":[{"family":"Gil","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Risam","given":"Roopika"}],"issue":"2,  \"Minimal Computing\"","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,28]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-ND 4.0","title":"Minimal Computing from the Labor Perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000600/000600.html","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Consalvo2019WhyWeNeed","abstract":"This chapter explains why that is, as well as to argue for the consistent need for a strong feminist engagement with popular culture, and game culture in particular, in the contemporary period. It highlights how feminist scholars must both continue to analyze the larger games industry for its structures and practices, as well as the field of game studies itself, which – knowingly or not – often marginalizes games or game content that is deemed as “feminized” and therefore “not worthy” of sustained attention. Boundaries are enforced where authentic game culture is considered masculine and women involved in gaming are considered casuals – read mass culture gamers, of less value than real gamers. Many scholars, journalists, and game developers have written about the lack of women in the game industry, particularly in the fields of programming and design. The culture surrounding games can be hostile to anyone who dares to critique the status quo of “traditional” gamer culture.","author":[{"family":"Consalvo","given":"Mia"}],"citation-key":"Consalvo2019WhyWeNeed","container-title":"The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Feminism","ISBN":"978-1-315-72834-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"number-of-pages":"12","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Why we need feminist game studies","type":"chapter"},

It addresses the amount of technically-oriented detail-work required to configure the complex set of components that underpin widely-used platforms for static site generation. When going “minimal” requires a great deal of technical labor, what implications does that have for its adoption by scholars without ongoing technical support, or the money or connections to delegate that work? What is the added emotional labor for technical collaborators who are only allowed to “consult” with scholars, when they attempt to coach scholars through implementing a minimal computing site on their own? What opportunities are lost when a web development methodology cannot reasonably be taught in a hands-on way in a short workshop? After describing these challenges, this paper proposes that an infrastructural intervention — encompassing everything from writing better documentation, tutorials, and templates, to developing interfaces that mediate between users and technical complexity — is necessary to realize the potential of minimal computing as a framework for sustainable websites.","author":[{"family":"Dombrowski","given":"Quinn"}],"citation-key":"Dombrowski2022MinimizingComputingMaximizes","container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","container-title-short":"DHQ","editor":[{"family":"Gil","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Risam","given":"Roopika"}],"issue":"2,  \"Minimal Computing\"","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,28]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-ND 4.0","title":"Minimizing Computing Maximizes Labor","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000594/000594.html","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Drucker2021Sustainability","abstract":"Abstract\n\nConcepts of sustainability touch every aspect of scholarly work and are particularly urgent in thinking about those practices that depend on digital technology. The costs of digital scholarship are frequently posed in terms of human labor and rights abuses, ecological and environmental damage, carbon footprints, waste of resources associated with obsolescence, and other issues that affect every stage of the lifecycle of production. But sustainability also needs to be understood as an epistemic concept embedded in complex systems, not merely as a set of problems to be solved through instrumental means applied to operational logistics. This article addresses mechanistic approaches to sustainability, while suggesting that the complexity of the concept of sustainability requires the humanistic methods and ethical principles to be engaged in decisions about future practices in pedagogy, research, and institutional sites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Drucker","given":"Johanna"}],"citation-key":"Drucker2021Sustainability","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","container-title-short":"Digit.

But what if certain games were something more than this, providing not only outlets for entertainment but a means for creative expression, instruments for conceptual thinking, or tools for social change? In Critical Play, artist and game designer Mary Flanagan examines alternative games—games that challenge the accepted norms embedded within the gaming industry—and argues that games designed by artists and activists are reshaping everyday game culture.\n\nFlanagan provides a lively historical context for critical play through twentieth-century art movements, connecting subversive game design to subversive art: her examples of “playing house” include Dadaist puppet shows and The Sims; her discussion of language play includes puns, palindromes, Yoko Ono’s Instruction Paintings, and Jenny Holzer’s messages in LED. Flanagan also looks at artists’ alternative computer-based games, examining projects from Persuasive Games and Gonzalo Frasca and other games created through the use of interventionist strategies in the design process. And she explores games for change, considering the way activist concerns—among them Darfur, worldwide poverty, and AIDS—can be incorporated into game design.\n\nArguing that this kind of conscious practice—which now constitutes the avant-garde of the computer game medium—can inspire new working methods for designers, Flanagan offers a model for designing that will encourage the subversion of popular gaming tropes through new styles of game making, and proposes a theory of alternate game design that focuses on the reworking of contemporary popular game practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Flanagan","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"Flanagan2009CriticalPlayRadical","event-place":"Cambridge","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en-US","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","title":"Critical Play: Radical Game Design","title-short":"Critical Play","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Grant.etal2020AbsorbingDiRTTool","abstract":"In the summer of 2017, Quinn Dombrowski, an IT staff member in UC Berkeley’s Research IT group, approached Geoffrey Rockwell about the possibility of merging the DiRT Directory with TAPoR, both popular tool discovery portals. Dombrowski could no longer offer the time commitment required to maintain the organizational structure of the volunteer-run tool directory (2018). This decommissioning of DiRT illustrates a set of problems in the digital humanities around tool directories and the tools within as academic contributions. Tool development, in general, is not considered sufficiently scholarly and often suffers from a lack of ongoing support (Ramsay &amp; Rockwell, 2012). When tool discovery portals are no longer maintained due to a lack of ongoing funding, this leads to a loss of digital humanities knowledge and history. While volunteer-based directories require less outright funding, managing and motivating those volunteers to ensure that they remain actively involved in directory upkeep requires a vast amount work to ensure long-term sustainability (Dombrowski, 2018). This paper will explore the difficult history of tool discovery catalogues and portals and the steps being taken to save the DiRT Directory by integrating it into TAPoR. In particular, we will: – Provide a brief history of the attempts to catalogue tools for digital humanists starting with the first software catalogues, such as those circulated through societies, and ending with digital discovery portals, including DiRT Directory and TAPoR. – Discuss the challenges around the maintenance of discovery portals – Consider the design and metadata decisions made in the merging of DiRT Directory with TAPoR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Grant","given":"Kaitlyn"},{"family":"Dombrowski","given":"Quinn"},{"family":"Ranaweera","given":"Kamal"},{"family":"Rodriguez-Arenas","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Sinclair","given":"Stéfan"},{"family":"Rockwell","given":"Geoffrey"}],"citation-key":"Grant.etal2020AbsorbingDiRTTool","container-title":"Digital Studies / Le champ numérique","container-title-short":"Digit.

  {"id":"Hirsch2015DigitalHumanitiesPedagogy","abstract":"Academic institutions are starting to recognize the growing public interest in digital humanities research, and there is an increasing demand from students for formal training in its methods. Despite the pressure on practitioners to develop innovative courses, scholarship in this area has tended to focus on research methods, theories and results rather than critical pedagogy and the actual practice of teaching.  The essays in this collection offer a timely intervention in digital humanities scholarship, bringing together established and emerging scholars from a variety of humanities disciplines across the world. The first section offers views on the practical realities of teaching digital humanities at undergraduate and graduate levels, presenting case studies and snapshots of the authors' experiences alongside models for future courses and reflections on pedagogical successes and failures. The next section proposes strategies for teaching foundational digital humanities methods across a variety of scholarly disciplines, and the book concludes with wider debates about the place of digital humanities in the academy, from the field's cultural assumptions and social obligations to its political visions.  Digital Humanities pedagogy broadens the ways in which both scholars and practitioners can think about this emerging discipline, ensuring its ongoing development, vitality and long-term sustainability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,8]]},"citation-key":"Hirsch2015DigitalHumanitiesPedagogy","collection-title":"Digital Humanities Series","editor":[{"family":"Hirsch","given":"Brett D."}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-2-8218-5403-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,1]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","number-of-pages":"xx-427","publisher":"Open Book Publishers","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"OpenEdition Books","title":"Digital Humanities Pedagogy : Practices, Principles and Politics","title-short":"Digital Humanities Pedagogy","type":"book","URL":"http://books.openedition.org/obp/1605"},

  {"id":"Hoy2018CardboardIndiansPlaying","abstract":"In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, board game makers depicted the West as a dangerous place and portrayed Native Americans as both violent savages and children of nature. Early game companies marketed their games by playing up the excitement of the Wild West to appeal to children, while emphasizing the historic, educational, and patriotic aspects of their games to appeal to parents. In this context, games provided a means to simplify complex ideas about manifest destiny, frontiers, identity, and violence in ways that young children could understand. The rise of Civil Rights activism in the 1960s and 1970s splintered the ways game companies portrayed Native Americans and the West. After the 1970s, game manufacturers attempted to appeal to a diverse set of markets in North America and Europe by portraying the West as a place of savage spectacles, as a place of historic interactions, and as a place devoid of conflict or violence. These competing portrayals emphasize the continued importance of the West to American conceptions of identity and the importance of game makers in creating meaningful arguments about the past that help to bridge the world of adults with the world of children.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoy","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"Hoy2018CardboardIndiansPlaying","container-title":"Western Historical Quarterly","container-title-short":"Western Historical Quarterly","DOI":"10.1093/whq/why036","ISSN":"0043-3810","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,1]]},"page":"299-324","source":"Silverchair","title":"Cardboard Indians: Playing History in the American West","title-short":"Cardboard Indians","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/whq/why036","volume":"49"},

This article investigated the potential of a custom-built board game as a means to teach historical empathy, improve class participation, and to improve student understanding of the limitations of archival collections.Method. Participant behavior as well as verbal and written feedback were collected during a pilot study of POLICING THE SOUND. A total of 88 undergraduate and graduate participants from History and Indigenous Studies took part during the pilot study.Results. Student participation and understanding of historical context improved during the game. While graduate and undergraduate students showed similarity in their enjoyment of the game and their belief that it made historical arguments, the curricular differences in graduate and undergraduate programs influenced how each group approached the game.Conclusion. Participant feedback, facilitator observation, and external observation indicate that groups of players can resolve confusion more efficiently than individual players can, time constrained decision-making may help maintain student engagement, an inability to win does not necessarily cause disengagement in short educational games, and that a structured debrief is important in achieving educational goals even in custom-built games.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoy","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"Hoy2018TeachingHistoryCustomBuilt","container-title":"Simulation & Gaming","container-title-short":"Simul.

  {"id":"Hughes.etal2015DigitalMethodsHumanities","abstract":"This chapter considers the impact and reach of digital methods in the humanities. Digital methods are a core element of what has been called the “methodological commons”: the intellectual, disciplinary, and methodological framework that underlies the conceptualization and understanding of digital humanities. The term “method” is used to refer to the computer-based (also called information and communications technology, or ICT) techniques for the creation, analysis, communication, and dissemination of digital research. This chapter revisits the theory of computer-based methods as a core construct (or “scholarly primitive”) of the digital humanities. It reviews two significant collaborative research support initiatives to investigate the use of ICT methods in the humanities, and explores the interdependencies between digital methods and the content and computer-based tools they are used with across these disciplines. The chapter also discusses recent initiatives to formalize the expression of ICT methods in the humanities, exploring how an emerging ontology of digital methods might contribute to wider adoption and understanding of digital humanities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Lorna"},{"family":"Constantopoulos","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"Hughes.etal2015DigitalMethodsHumanities","container-title":"A New Companion to Digital Humanities","DOI":"10.1002/9781118680605.ch11","ISBN":"978-1-118-68060-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118680605.ch11","page":"150-170","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","section":"11","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Digital Methods in the Humanities: Understanding and Describing their Use across the Disciplines","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118680605.ch11"},

  {"id":"JannidisFlanders2019GentleIntroduction","abstract":"Data and its technologies now play a large and growing role in humanities research and teaching. This book addresses the needs of humanities scholars who seek deeper expertise in the area of data modeling and representation. The authors, all experts in digital humanities, offer a clear explanation of key technical principles, a grounded discussion of case studies, and an exploration of important theoretical concerns. The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context. This book is a unique and invaluable resource for teaching and practising data modeling in a digital humanities context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jannidis","given":"Fotis"},{"family":"Flanders","given":"Julia"}],"citation-key":"JannidisFlanders2019GentleIntroduction","collection-title":"Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities","container-title":"The Shape of Data in Digital Humanities: Modeling Texts and Text-based Resources","editor":[{"family":"Flanders","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Jannidis","given":"Fotis"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-367-58403-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"26-95","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","title":"A gentle introduction to data modeling","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"Kaden.Kleineberg2019ScholarlyMakerspacesZwischenbericht","abstract":"An der Universitätsbibliothek der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin wird aktuell eine Konzeptstudie zur Idee der so genannten Scholarly Makerspaces erarbeitet. Mit diesem Ansatz soll die Vermittlung von Bausteinen der digitalen Forschung in den Kultur- und Geisteswissenschaften auch über den Kernbereich der Digital Humanities hinaus auf lokaler Ebene verbessert werden. Aus bibliothekarischer Sicht versteht sich die Idee zugleich als ein Angebot, um die Rolle von Universitätsbibliotheken in ihrem jeweiligen Bedingungs- und Wirkungsrahmen explizit als Partner der Forschung zu untersuchen und Möglichkeiten einer differenzierten Vermittlung so genannter digitaler Literarizitäten über den sehr allgemeinen Begriff der Informationskompetenz hinaus auszuloten. Aus Sicht der Entwicklung von digitalen Forschungswerkzeugen ermöglichen Scholarly Makerspaces einen besseren Zugang zu Zielgruppen in der Breite und damit neue Vermittlungs- und Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten für Anbietende. Der Bericht dokumentiert den Zwischenstand anhand ausgewählter Aspekte. Die Gesamtstudie wird Ende des Jahres 2019 vorgelegt.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaden","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Kleineberg","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"Kaden.Kleineberg2019ScholarlyMakerspacesZwischenbericht","DOI":"10.18452/20331","ISSN":"1860-7950","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"ger","license":"CC BY 4.0","note":"Accepted: 2019-07-29T12:35:57Z","publisher":"Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin; https://web.archive.org/web/20200827141238/https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/21088","source":"edoc.hu-berlin.de","title":"Scholarly Makerspaces – Ein Zwischenbericht zum DFG-Projekt FuReSH","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/21088"},

  {"id":"Pawlicka-Deger2019MappingHistoryHumanities","abstract":"The last years can be called as a boom of laboratories in the humanities created as a physical space and as a ‘placeless’ project (virtual labs, lab podcasts) for a specific purpose and for a fixed period. The multiplication of labs has led to a state of emergency when it becomes significant to investigate their objectives and operation. Hence, I pose the following questions: What does a laboratory mean in the humanities? How has a laboratory been growing from a physical workspace into an action taken around people and challenges? How has the transition occurred from the first experimental wave to the second wave of the humanities lab? How does the lab affect the research practices and the place of humanities within the university?\n\nMy goal is to present the lab history in the humanities, digital humanities, and media studies in a global scope from the 80s of the twentieth century to 2018. The purpose is to explore their forerunners like the art studio and the technoscience lab, investigate the mechanism of their establishment and analyze their functions and operation. The main part of my research is a map of laboratories established in the humanities and media studies all over the world. Based on a survey and laboratories’ statements, I created an interactive map with labs’ descriptions and timeline to analyze the concept of the humanities lab from geographical and historical perspectives.\n\nIt is vital to understand the phenomenon of laboratory in the humanities that entails significant changes in the research practices and scholarly communication. The humanities labs do not represent a unified structure but they are a cluster of various models which have their own architectures and practices. Hence, the humanities labs do not purely imitate the science lab but adapt this new structure for its own purposes and needs.","author":[{"family":"Pawlicka-Deger","given":"Urszula"}],"citation-key":"Pawlicka-Deger2019MappingHistoryHumanities","event-place":"Michigan State University","event-title":"Global Digital Humanities Symposium","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,21]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Michigan State University","title":"Mapping the History of the Humanities and Media Labs","type":"speech"},

  {"id":"Scheiding2020ZombiesVaultsViolence","abstract":"This dissertation examines the representation of atomic/nuclear weapons and fears within video games through the lens of collective/cultural memory, historiography, game studies and critical theory. These diverse fields are combined into a research typology labelled as discourses of the past which argues that the past is mediated based upon the needs of entrenched power for use in, and the organization of, the present. The study focuses specifically on the representation of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 in both their American and Japanese contexts. The dissertation first engages with key works in the relevant fields. This literature review grounds the work in established theory while also defining and outlining the discourses of the past research typology. The second major section engages in a discussion of the author’s positionality and describes the methodological considerations of the typology.\n \nThrough a historiographical analysis, the dissertation argues that the dominant discourses of the past of the atomic bombings in the United States/West is to justify the use of the bombs while erasing Japanese victims. This is further examined in three case studies of American games: Fallout 4, Far Cry 5, and Far Cry New Dawn. A historiographical analysis of Japanese sources finds that there is no one dominant collective/cultural memory and, instead, atomic bomb and war memory is diffused into three discourses of the past (a hero/victim/perpetrator memory triad) where no one discourse is entirely dominant or marginalized. Instead, the relative power of each is dictated by person, place, space, and/or temporality. This is further explored in a case study of three Japanese games: Resident Evil 3, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, and Valkyria Chronicles 4.\n\nThrough the combination of theory, historiography, and case studies the dissertation ultimately argues that the selected games mimic the dominant discourses of the past while also adhering to established video game genre conventions and expectations. These findings are then put into contemporary context to argue for the continued relevance of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheiding","given":"Ryan"}],"citation-key":"Scheiding2020ZombiesVaultsViolence","genre":"phd","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,15]]},"language":"en","license":"term_access","number-of-pages":"308","publisher":"Concordia University","source":"spectrum.library.concordia.ca","title":"Zombies, Vaults & Violence: Collective Memory and the Representation of Atomic Fears in Video Games","title-short":"Zombies, Vaults & Violence","type":"thesis","URL":"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/987927/?fbclid=IwAR10icBtVUL0ze-31Ybh0ZyPkTCkLXH4ijFTPsQlQoxHyrNNwSMpI5OZ6N8"},

  {"id":"ShirkEtAl2012PublicParticipation","abstract":"ABSTRACT. Members of the public participate in scientific research in many different contexts, stemming from traditions as varied as participatory action research and citizen science. Particularly in conservation and natural resource management contexts, where research often addresses complex social–ecological questions, the emphasis on and nature of this participation can significantly affect both the way that projects are designed and the outcomes that projects achieve. We review and integrate recent work in these and other fields, which has converged such that we propose the term public participation in scientific research (PPSR) to discuss initiatives from diverse fields and traditions. We describe three predominant models of PPSR and call upon case studies suggesting that—regardless of the research context—project outcomes are influenced by (1) the degree of public participation in the research process and (2) the quality of public participation as negotiated during project design. To illustrate relationships between the quality of participation and outcomes, we offer a framework that considers how scientific and public interests are negotiated for project design toward multiple, integrated goals. We suggest that this framework and models, used in tandem, can support deliberate design of PPSR efforts that will enhance their outcomes for scientific research, individual participants, and social–ecological systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Shirk","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Ballard","given":"Heidi L."},{"family":"Wilderman","given":"Candie C."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Wiggins","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"McCallie","given":"Ellen"},{"family":"Minarchek","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Lewenstein","given":"Bruce V."},{"family":"Krasny","given":"Marianne E."},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Rick"}],"citation-key":"ShirkEtAl2012PublicParticipation","container-title":"Ecology and Society","container-title-short":"Ecol.

Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining.Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES.Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire?s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning.Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods.Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Sideris","given":"Grigorios"},{"family":"Xinogalos","given":"Stelios"}],"citation-key":"Sideris.Xinogalos2019PYRATEADVENTURES2D","container-title":"Simulation & Gaming","container-title-short":"Simul.

  {"id":"Strubell.etal+2019+EnergyAndPolicy","abstract":"Recent progress in hardware and methodology for training neural networks has ushered in a new generation of large networks trained on abundant data. These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both ﬁnancially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate ﬁnancial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these ﬁndings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Strubell","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Ganesh","given":"Ananya"},{"family":"McCallum","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Strubell.etal+2019+EnergyAndPolicy","container-title":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","container-title-short":"Proc. 57th Annu.

  {"id":"Wythoff2022MinimalComputing","abstract":"Originally devised as an insult by Richard Wollheim, the term “minimalism” described a 1960s movement that foregrounded the relationship between an art object and its museum viewer. Today, minimalism is the guiding ethos for a surprising variety of pop cultural phenomena, from belongings that spark joy to contemplative practice that increases mindfulness. This article first takes a broader view of minimalism to register several problematic echoes of minimal computing among digital detoxers and disaster survivalists in intensities ranging from Luddism to asceticism. Attention needs to be given to these echoes, especially when valorizing DIY infrastructures built out of necessity by Indigenous, poor, or coastal communities and out of privilege by doomsday preppers. Second, this article asks what becomes of minimal computing now that we have seen the vital importance of maximal connection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Do arguments for minimalism still hold in a socially-distant, unevenly-connected world? I argue that it will be important to reframe the digital minimalist conversations of the 2010s for the demands of digital equity in the 2020s. Going forward, we should ask: which of these competing claims to minimalism — as a form of attention, mindfulness, and agency — are compatible with maximal connection, with maximal choice, with maximal investment in communities and infrastructures? And when we hold up minimalism as a virtue, is that virtue a property of particular tools or specific techniques for using them? Finally, this article profiles the ways that academic conversations on minimal computing have independently taken root outside universities through grassroots organizing and activism under the banner of community technology. I close by suggesting ways that minimal computing can be led by community input, while also playing a role in public scholarship and community partnerships that extend existing academic research.","author":[{"family":"Wythoff","given":"Grant"}],"citation-key":"Wythoff2022MinimalComputing","container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","container-title-short":"DHQ","editor":[{"family":"Gil","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Risam","given":"Roopika"}],"issue":"2,  \"Minimal Computing\"","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,28]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-ND 4.0","note":"date_read: 2020-08-30","title":"Ensuring Minimal Computing Serves Maximal Connection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000596/000596.html","volume":"16"},
