  {"id":"BenderEtAl2021DangersStochasticParrots","abstract":"The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"},{"family":"McMillan-Major","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Shmitchell","given":"Shmargaret"}],"citation-key":"BenderEtAl2021DangersStochasticParrots","collection-title":"FAccT '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","container-title-short":"Proc. 2021 ACM Conf.

  {"id":"Cebral-Loureda2022InteractiveExploratoryAnalysis","abstract":"Already in 2011, David Berry talked about 3 waves in Digital Humanities (DH): a first moment marked by digitalization when technologies were understood as tools to help humanistic management; a second moment, based on natively digital products, conceiving the tools in their generative mode; finally, Berry intuits a third moment in which the computational revolution would be the motor of the humanistic studies development.\n\nSince 2011 many things have happened, especially talking about knowledge areas affected by technologies and their implementations. For example, around 2015 and next years, Big Data was a very powerful trend, which impacted most of the academic research, including humanities and social sciences. Some years later, around 2017, a turn happened with the consolidation of the term Artificial Intelligence, which became even a more paradigmatic trend. All these changes have had to influence DH: How have the field assimilated the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence revolutions? Are the waves detected by Berry still valid or there are needed new ones? What are the trends, concepts and approaches that are dominating the most recent DH studies? What texts and authors were the most influential ones to carry on these transformations?\n\nTo answer these questions, an analytical review of the historic academic production is proposed. The analysis was performed over the academic database Scopus, and analyzed with R programming tools, applying computational analytics in a bibliometric way. The findings are deployed in a public site that will be the product presented and discussed during the meeting, providing interactive visualizations elaborated with plotly, shiny apps and the Sigma JS plugin for networks. Based on this interactive mode, a collaborative research using the site as a tool is planned.","author":[{"family":"Cebral-Loureda","given":"Manuel"}],"citation-key":"Cebral-Loureda2022InteractiveExploratoryAnalysis","event-place":"online","event-title":"Global Digital Humanities Symposium","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,23]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"online","title":"Interactive Exploratory Analysis for DH Trends","type":"speech","URL":"https://msuglobaldh.org/abstracts/#cebral-loureda"},

We begin this essay with a case study of one such system, called ‚ÄúVault,‚Äù in the University of Victoria Libraries, and the work required to migrate from a Software as a Service (SAAS) model (called ContentDM) to a free and open-source software (FOSS) model (a customized instance of Samvera).\n\nVault illustrates what we call ‚Äúminimal computing from the labor perspective,‚Äù which seeks to reduce the opacity of software through ‚Äúlow-tech‚Äù practices such as pseudocode, thereby reducing the alienation of practitioners from their projects. Drawing from feminist ecological work on capitalism, affective labor, and care, we advocate for the ‚Äúdegrowth‚Äù of digital projects by resisting tendencies to reinvest surplus labor and value into increased productivity. Instead, degrowth as minimal computing prompts practitioners to articulate a project‚Äôs needs and desires; what work is required and from whom; and how or whether to sustain this labor for the future.","author":[{"family":"Chan","given":"Tiffany"},{"family":"Sayers","given":"Jentery"}],"citation-key":"Chan.Sayers2022MinimalComputingLabor","container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","container-title-short":"DHQ","editor":[{"family":"Gil","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Risam","given":"Roopika"}],"issue":"2,  \"Minimal Computing\"","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,28]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-ND 4.0","title":"Minimal Computing from the Labor Perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000600/000600.html","volume":"16"},

It addresses the amount of technically-oriented detail-work required to configure the complex set of components that underpin widely-used platforms for static site generation. When going ‚Äúminimal‚Äù requires a great deal of technical labor, what implications does that have for its adoption by scholars without ongoing technical support, or the money or connections to delegate that work? What is the added emotional labor for technical collaborators who are only allowed to ‚Äúconsult‚Äù with scholars, when they attempt to coach scholars through implementing a minimal computing site on their own? What opportunities are lost when a web development methodology cannot reasonably be taught in a hands-on way in a short workshop?

  {"id":"Drucker2021Sustainability","abstract":"Abstract\n\nConcepts of sustainability touch every aspect of scholarly work and are particularly urgent in thinking about those practices that depend on digital technology. The costs of digital scholarship are frequently posed in terms of human labor and rights abuses, ecological and environmental damage, carbon footprints, waste of resources associated with obsolescence, and other issues that affect every stage of the lifecycle of production. But sustainability also needs to be understood as an epistemic concept embedded in complex systems, not merely as a set of problems to be solved through instrumental means applied to operational logistics. This article addresses mechanistic approaches to sustainability, while suggesting that the complexity of the concept of sustainability requires the humanistic methods and ethical principles to be engaged in decisions about future practices in pedagogy, research, and institutional sites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Drucker","given":"Johanna"}],"citation-key":"Drucker2021Sustainability","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","container-title-short":"Digit.

The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context.

  {"id":"Grant.etal2020AbsorbingDiRTTool","abstract":"In the summer of 2017, Quinn Dombrowski, an IT staff member in UC Berkeley‚Äôs Research IT group, approached Geoffrey Rockwell about the possibility of merging the DiRT Directory with TAPoR, both popular tool discovery portals. Dombrowski could no longer offer the time commitment required to maintain the organizational structure of the volunteer-run tool directory (2018). This decommissioning of DiRT illustrates a set of problems in the digital humanities around tool directories and the tools within as academic contributions. Tool development, in general, is not considered sufficiently scholarly and often suffers from a lack of ongoing support (Ramsay &amp; Rockwell, 2012). When tool discovery portals are no longer maintained due to a lack of ongoing funding, this leads to a loss of digital humanities knowledge and history. While volunteer-based directories require less outright funding, managing and motivating those volunteers to ensure that they remain actively involved in directory upkeep requires a vast amount work to ensure long-term sustainability (Dombrowski, 2018). This paper will explore the difficult history of tool discovery catalogues and portals and the steps being taken to save the DiRT Directory by integrating it into TAPoR. In particular, we will: ‚Äì Provide a brief history of the attempts to catalogue tools for digital humanists starting with the first software catalogues, such as those circulated through societies, and ending with digital discovery portals, including DiRT Directory and TAPoR. ‚Äì Discuss the challenges around the maintenance of discovery portals ‚Äì Consider the design and metadata decisions made in the merging of DiRT Directory with TAPoR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Grant","given":"Kaitlyn"},{"family":"Dombrowski","given":"Quinn"},{"family":"Ranaweera","given":"Kamal"},{"family":"Rodriguez-Arenas","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Sinclair","given":"St√©fan"},{"family":"Rockwell","given":"Geoffrey"}],"citation-key":"Grant.etal2020AbsorbingDiRTTool","container-title":"Digital Studies / Le champ num√©rique","container-title-short":"Digit.

  {"id":"Hirsch2015DigitalHumanitiesPedagogy","abstract":"Academic institutions are starting to recognize the growing public interest in digital humanities research, and there is an increasing demand from students for formal training in its methods. Despite the pressure on practitioners to develop innovative courses, scholarship in this area has tended to focus on research methods, theories and results rather than critical pedagogy and the actual practice of teaching.  The essays in this collection offer a timely intervention in digital humanities scholarship, bringing together established and emerging scholars from a variety of humanities disciplines across the world. The first section offers views on the practical realities of teaching digital humanities at undergraduate and graduate levels, presenting case studies and snapshots of the authors' experiences alongside models for future courses and reflections on pedagogical successes and failures. The next section proposes strategies for teaching foundational digital humanities methods across a variety of scholarly disciplines, and the book concludes with wider debates about the place of digital humanities in the academy, from the field's cultural assumptions and social obligations to its political visions.  Digital Humanities pedagogy broadens the ways in which both scholars and practitioners can think about this emerging discipline, ensuring its ongoing development, vitality and long-term sustainability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,8]]},"citation-key":"Hirsch2015DigitalHumanitiesPedagogy","collection-title":"Digital Humanities Series","editor":[{"family":"Hirsch","given":"Brett D."}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-2-8218-5403-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,1]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","number-of-pages":"xx-427","publisher":"Open Book Publishers","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"OpenEdition Books","title":"Digital Humanities Pedagogy : Practices, Principles and Politics","title-short":"Digital Humanities Pedagogy","type":"book","URL":"http://books.openedition.org/obp/1605"},
  {"id":"Hughes.etal2015DigitalMethodsHumanities","abstract":"This chapter considers the impact and reach of digital methods in the humanities. Digital methods are a core element of what has been called the ‚Äúmethodological commons‚Äù: the intellectual, disciplinary, and methodological framework that underlies the conceptualization and understanding of digital humanities. The term ‚Äúmethod‚Äù is used to refer to the computer-based (also called information and communications technology, or ICT) techniques for the creation, analysis, communication, and dissemination of digital research. This chapter revisits the theory of computer-based methods as a core construct (or ‚Äúscholarly primitive‚Äù) of the digital humanities. It reviews two significant collaborative research support initiatives to investigate the use of ICT methods in the humanities, and explores the interdependencies between digital methods and the content and computer-based tools they are used with across these disciplines. The chapter also discusses recent initiatives to formalize the expression of ICT methods in the humanities, exploring how an emerging ontology of digital methods might contribute to wider adoption and understanding of digital humanities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Lorna"},{"family":"Constantopoulos","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"Hughes.etal2015DigitalMethodsHumanities","container-title":"A New Companion to Digital Humanities","DOI":"10.1002/9781118680605.ch11","ISBN":"978-1-118-68060-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118680605.ch11","page":"150-170","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","section":"11","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Digital Methods in the Humanities: Understanding and Describing their Use across the Disciplines","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118680605.ch11"},

This book addresses the needs of humanities scholars who seek deeper expertise in the area of data modeling and representation. The authors, all experts in digital humanities, offer a clear explanation of key technical principles, a grounded discussion of case studies, and an exploration of important theoretical concerns. The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context.

  {"id":"Pawlicka-Deger2019MappingHistoryHumanities","abstract":"The last years can be called as a boom of laboratories in the humanities created as a physical space and as a ‚Äòplaceless‚Äô project (virtual labs, lab podcasts) for a specific purpose and for a fixed period. The multiplication of labs has led to a state of emergency when it becomes significant to investigate their objectives and operation. Hence, I pose the following questions: What does a laboratory mean in the humanities? How has a laboratory been growing from a physical workspace into an action taken around people and challenges? How has the transition occurred from the first experimental wave to the second wave of the humanities lab? How does the lab affect the research practices and the place of humanities within the university?\n\nMy goal is to present the lab history in the humanities, digital humanities, and media studies in a global scope from the 80s of the twentieth century to 2018. The purpose is to explore their forerunners like the art studio and the technoscience lab, investigate the mechanism of their establishment and analyze their functions and operation. The main part of my research is a map of laboratories established in the humanities and media studies all over the world. Based on a survey and laboratories‚Äô statements, I created an interactive map with labs‚Äô descriptions and timeline to analyze the concept of the humanities lab from geographical and historical perspectives.\n\nIt is vital to understand the phenomenon of laboratory in the humanities that entails significant changes in the research practices and scholarly communication. The humanities labs do not represent a unified structure but they are a cluster of various models which have their own architectures and practices. Hence, the humanities labs do not purely imitate the science lab but adapt this new structure for its own purposes and needs.","author":[{"family":"Pawlicka-Deger","given":"Urszula"}],"citation-key":"Pawlicka-Deger2019MappingHistoryHumanities","event-place":"Michigan State University","event-title":"Global Digital Humanities Symposium","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,21]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Michigan State University","title":"Mapping the History of the Humanities and Media Labs","type":"speech"},

Members of the public participate in scientific research in many different contexts, stemming from traditions as varied as participatory action research and citizen science. Particularly in conservation and natural resource management contexts, where research often addresses complex social‚Äìecological questions, the emphasis on and nature of this participation can significantly affect both the way that projects are designed and the outcomes that projects achieve. We review and integrate recent work in these and other fields, which has converged such that we propose the term public participation in scientific research (PPSR) to discuss initiatives from diverse fields and traditions. We describe three predominant models of PPSR and call upon case studies suggesting that‚Äîregardless of the research context‚Äîproject outcomes are influenced by (1) the degree of public participation in the research process and (2) the quality of public participation as negotiated during project design. To illustrate relationships between the quality of participation and outcomes, we offer a framework that considers how scientific and public interests are negotiated for project design toward multiple, integrated goals. We suggest that this framework and models, used in tandem, can support deliberate design of PPSR efforts that will enhance their outcomes for scientific research, individual participants, and social‚Äìecological systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Shirk","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Ballard","given":"Heidi L."},{"family":"Wilderman","given":"Candie C."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Wiggins","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"McCallie","given":"Ellen"},{"family":"Minarchek","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Lewenstein","given":"Bruce V."},{"family":"Krasny","given":"Marianne E."},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Rick"}],"citation-key":"ShirkEtAl2012PublicParticipation","container-title":"Ecology and Society","container-title-short":"Ecol.

In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate Ô¨Ånancial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP.
